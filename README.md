# SlashGaming Diablo II Free Display Fix
A universal fix of display related issues and backport of features from 1.14 for Diablo II.

## Features
- Removes the symbol cycling issue when changing resolutions for the DirectDraw, Direct3D, and Glide video modes for newer Windows versions and graphics cards. Game startup should now be much quicker.
- Fixes crash when starting Direct3D in video mode for newer Windows versions and graphics cards.
- DirectDraw can now be used in all versions above 1.13C, and the video mode can be selected by the appropriate entry in the registry.

## How to Use
Use a program to inject the DLL file into Game.exe.

## Multiplayer Use
This patch will work in any multiplayer setting, but using this patch in Battle.net will most likely get you banned.
